the project already has a file with trained neural network weights and it is enough to click the "upload" button to upload them and test the ability of the program to recognize numbers (from zero to five) in the drawing window. if there is a need to monitor how the neural network is trained from scratch, you can delete the "trained.csv" file from the project and click "train" when starting the program. this function creates a new file "trained.csv" and by clicking "upload" you can test its operation. as a rule, one training cycle is not enough for recognition.


p.s. use the "train", "upload" buttons and the drawing window. other buttons and elements besides the diagram were needed during development
